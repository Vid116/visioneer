# 3 Fascinating Facts About Octopuses

## Fact 1: Octopuses Have Nine Brains
- Octopuses have one central brain and eight "mini-brains" in each arm
- The central brain processes information and makes decisions
- Each arm's mini-brain can act independently - able to taste, touch, and move without direction from the central brain
- Two-thirds of an octopus's 500 million neurons are in its arms, not its head
- This allows them to multitask - arms can crack open shellfish while the octopus explores other areas
- Proven in experiments where octopuses learned to guide arms through mazes to reach food

## Fact 2: Octopuses Have Three Hearts and Blue Blood
- Two hearts pump blood through the gills to pick up oxygen
- The third heart circulates oxygenated blood to organs and muscles
- The main heart stops beating when swimming, which is why octopuses prefer crawling
- Their blood is blue due to hemocyanin, a copper-based protein instead of iron-based hemoglobin
- Hemocyanin is more efficient at transporting oxygen in cold, low-oxygen deep ocean environments
- However, this makes them extremely sensitive to ocean acidity changes

## Fact 3: Octopuses Are Master Shape-Shifters with Four Types of Color Cells
- **Chromatophores**: Elastic sacs of pigment that can contract or expand instantly to show colors like black, brown, orange, red, or yellow
- **Iridophores**: Stacks of reflective plates that create metallic blues, greens, golds, and silvers - the color changes based on viewing angle
- **Leucophores**: Light-scattering cells that create white coloration and provide a "blank canvas" for other color cells
- **Photophores**: Light-producing organs found in deep-sea species that create bioluminescence
- Can change color faster than you can blink - literally think about a color and instantly display it
- The Giant Australian Cuttlefish has the highest "dots per inch" of color cells, like having a TV screen as skin
